# 🛡️ NIRAPOTTA - Backend API (নিরাপত্তা)

The server-side engine for the **Nirapotta** safety ecosystem. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it handles real-time emergency services, AI-powered face recognition, and secure user authentication.

## 🚀 Key Modules

### 🆘 Emergency Response Engine
- **Geo-Spatial SOS**: Uses MongoDB 2dsphere indexing to instantly find the 3 nearest police stations.
- **Multi-Channel Alerts**: Notifies police via email/API, sends SMS to emergency contacts, and push notifications to nearby users (500m radius).
- **Life Path Tracking**: Records and serves real-time GPS breadcrumbs of the user in distress.

### 🧠 Face Recognition Service
- **AI Analytics**: Integrated `face-api.js` for identifying individuals in uploaded SOS videos.
- **Recognition Pipeline**: Automatically extracts frames, detects faces, and compares them against the `backend/dataset`.
- **Match Alerts**: Includes identified criminal/missing person data in police reports.

### 🔒 Security & Auth
- **OTP Verification**: Phone and email verification via mock (dev) or Twilio/NodeMailer (prod).
- **App Guard**: Support for secondary PIN/Password authentication for sensitive user settings.
- **Privacy First**: Encryption for all sensitive fields and high-security HTTP headers via Helmet.
